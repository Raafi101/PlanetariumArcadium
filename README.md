# Planetarium Arcadium
A full (PERN) stack planetary system visualizer web app
created by the "AstroNerds", a team of 4 people in their 
CS minor capstone class. The data was obtained from the 
NASA Exoplanet Archive and stored in a PostgreSQL 
database served through an Express server with more than 
3000 items. Front end built using JavaScript, React.js, 
and Node.js. The project is hosted in an AWS EC2 instance 
on a Ubuntu server. Users are able to search up, 
visualize, and learn about distant stars and orbiting planets.

# How To Use
Click "Start exploring" and you will be guided to a search bar. 
Now you can enter the name of a star or a planet. Click on a 
search result to view that planetary system. You can adjust the 
zoom and the speed/direction in time the planets move.

# Have Fun!
